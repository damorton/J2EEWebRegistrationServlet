			<p class="myH1">Learning journeys and learner voices - promoting
				innovative pedagogies through new technologies.</p>
			<p class="myH2 red">
				Gráinne Conole<br /> University of Leicester
			</p>

			<p class="myBody">New technologies offer a rich variety of ways
				in which learners can interact with learning materials and
				communicate and collaborate with others. Mobile devices means
				learning anywhere anytime is now a reality. The talk will provide an
				overview of different technologies and how they can facilitate
				different pedagogical approaches. However, learners and teachers
				lack the necessary digital literacies to harness the power of new
				media. A new approach to Learning Design will be described, which
				aims to help practitioners make more informed design decisions that
				are pedagogically effective and make innovative use of new
				technologies.</p>

			<p class="myH2 red">Biography</p>
			<p class="myBody">Gráinne Conole is Professor of learning
				innovation at Leicester University. Her research interests include
				the use, integration and evaluation of technologies and their impact
				on organisational change. Two of her interests are learning design
				and Open Educational Resources. She serves on and chairs a number of
				national and international advisory boards, steering groups,
				committees and international conference programmes. She has
				published and presented nearly 1000 conference proceedings,
				workshops and articles and keeps a blog www.e4innovation.com. She
				has a PhD in X-Ray Crystallography. She is author of a new Springer
				entitled: ‘Designing for learning in an open world’.&#160;</p>

				<em>“To exist, humanly, is to </em>name<em> the world, to
					change it. Once named, the world in its turn reappears to the
					namers as a problem and requires of them a new naming. Human beings
					are not built in silence, but in word, in work, in
					action-reflection.”— Paulo Freire</em>
			</p>
			<p class="myBody">Human beings are not built in silence. We
				delight in the first sounds of babies, the first words of children;
				we marvel at their acquisition of language. And in classrooms, at
				all levels of education, what do we ask of growing children and
				adults? Too often, while we speak, we ask for silence. The
				architecture of most of our classrooms and lecture halls both
				reflects and contributes to this. As educators, many of us have
				rediscovered the power of word, work and action-reflection in our
				own learning. We speak, we write, we use social media to share and
				to engage in dialogue. A growing number of educators are inviting
				students to do the same. Creating opportunities for students to find
				and share their voices requires openness and a willingness to
				challenge long-held assumptions and practices – those of our
				students and institutions as well as ourselves. Catherine will share
				the voices of students, from all levels of education, as well as her
				work and the work of other open educators, as she explores ways to
				create spaces for student voices.</p>
			<p class="myH2 red">Biography:&#160;&#160;</p>
			<p class="myBody">Catherine Cronin is Academic Coordinator of
				online IT programmes and Lecturer [sic] in Information Technology at
				the National University of Ireland, Galway. Catherine’s work focuses
				on open education, digital literacies and social media in education.
				Catherine is a contributor at many education conferences and was an
				invited keynote speaker at the 2012 Galway Symposium on Higher
				Education where she spoke about the challenges of open education for
				higher education. In addition to her work in HE, Catherine works
				with students, teachers and parents at both primary and second level
				to explore e-safety and social media for learning. She is a
				long-time advocate for girls and women in technology, working to
				challenge gender stereotypes and change gendered cultures. Happiest
				when crossing boundaries and bridging cultures, Catherine is a New
				Yorker living in Galway; has degrees in Mechanical Engineering,
				Systems Engineering and Women’s Studies; has taught in community
				settings, the Open University and HE in Ireland and Scotland; and is
				a passionate advocate for the power of social media to connect us
				and to transform learning.&#160;</p>

			<p class="myH2 red">Martha Rotter</p>

			<p class="myBody">Classrooms today are being flipped upside down
				by the addition of digital content and new portable devices. How can
				educators take advantage of these new tools and use them to enhance
				learning instead of distract? How can students understand how to
				make their voices heard, both in the classroom and further afield?
				Martha Rotter walks you through some of the most game-changing ideas
				in this space today.</p>
			<p class="myH2 red">Biography:&#160;&#160;</p>
			<p class="myBody">Martha Rotter is a developer and technologist
				based in Dublin, Ireland, focused on the digital publishing space.
				Through her tech startup company, Woopie (http://woop.ie), she helps
				educators, students, publishers, corporations and independent
				writers to create content and learning materials that are beautiful
				and work great on any device and platform. After co-founding Idea
				magazine in 2011, she wanted to help other people make beautiful
				reading experiences too, and began working on Woopie full-time.</p>
			<p class="myBody">Martha has been a part-time computer science
				lecturer at National College Ireland and the Digital Skills Academy
				for a number of years and was formerly the CTO of a New York based
				digital publisher. From 2001-2010 she was a software engineer,
				technical manager and developer evangelist at Microsoft. She holds
				bachelor&#39;s degrees in computer science, business administration,
				and international studies, and has done graduate work in the areas
				of natural language processing, data visualization and human
				computer interaction. In her spare time she works with community
				tech groups like Age Action, OpenCoffee Dublin, and women&#39;s
				technology initiatives. She is on twitter at @martharotter and blogs
				about technology and publishing at martharotter.com/blog.</p>
